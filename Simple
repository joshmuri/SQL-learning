A simple project

The lab instruction

In this part of the lab, you will practice using basic SQL commands to interact 
with a simple database.

- Create a new database named "LabDB."
- Create a table named "Students" with the following columns:
	- StudentID (INT, primary key)
	- FirstName (VARCHAR(50))
	- LastName (VARCHAR(50))
	- Age (INT)
	- GPA (DECIMAL(3,2))

- Insert at least 5 records into the "Students" table with sample data.
- Write SQL queries to perform the following tasks:
	A. Retrieve all records from the "Students" table.
	B. Retrieve the records of students with a GPA greater than 3.5.
	C. Update the age of a specific student.
	D. Delete a student record from the table.

Instructions to run

#1 - CREATE DATABASE LabDB;

USE LabDB;

CREATE TABLE students (
	StudentsID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	FirstName VarChar(50),
	LastName VarChar(50),
	Age INT,
	GPA DECIMAL (3,2)
	)

#2 - Inserting random
INSERT INTO Students (StudentsID, FirstName, LastName, Age, GPA) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Smith', 19, 3.5),
(2, 'Bob', 'JOnes', 20, 3.2),
(3, 'Charlie', 'Brown', 18, 2.9),
(4, 'David', 'Lee', 21, 3.8),
(5, 'Emma', 'Wang', 19, 4.0);

#3 - Select all the records
Select * from students;

#4 - Students with GPA > 3.5;
SELECT * FROM 'students' WHERE 'GPA' > 3.5;

#5 - update
UPDATE 'students' SET 'Age' = 20 WHERE 'StudentsID' = 3;

#6 - Deletion
DELETE FROM 'students' WHERE 'StudentsID' = 2;
